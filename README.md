# RaspTop OS - OS for Raspberry Pi and PC

RaspTop OS is a OS for Raspberry Pi and PC. It's focused and well-tested on the Raspberry Pi.

It's tested on PC, but not as well-tested as the Pi. On the Pi it's tested on Raspbian Stretch (Lite). In the future there's a image you can flash for the Pi.

## Installing

To install the OS, you can run the install-[distro].sh. I recommend you to copy and paste the script, because WGET is not working very well. The script must be run as root.

## Uninstalling

If you're not happy with the OS or want to remove it for some reason, you can run the uninstaller script. It's recommend to take a look at the source code, because it will remove packages you may be using.
